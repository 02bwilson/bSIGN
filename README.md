# bSIGN

bSIGN is a simple Python program I created in just a few hours for fun. It signs files with different SHA hash functions.

## Usage

To use bSIGN, install the requirements and simply run the following command:

```python bSIGN.py```

This will launch the bSIGN GUI application. From there, you can select the file you want to sign and choose the desired hash function from a dropdown menu.

## Note
Please note that bSIGN is just a fun project I created in about two hours, and is not intended for any serious use. Use at your own risk.

Thank you for checking out bSIGN!
